"""
auto_repair.py removed per user request.

This file was a helper to attempt automatic re-uploads for invalid Telegram file_ids.
You asked to remove it; keeping this stub avoids accidental execution and documents the removal.

If you want the original script back later, provide the backup or ask me to recreate it.
